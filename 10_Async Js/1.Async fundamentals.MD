*** This the default JS Part ***    
--------------------------------
-> Javascript --- 1. Synchronous 2.Single Threaded

Q1.What is Synchronous JS?
    => Synchronous JS means that JS can do one code at a time, it can't run code 2 in a single time.

Q2.What is Single Threaded JS?
    => Single Threaded means all code will be execute in one threaded

Q3.What is Execution Context type in JS? (interview)
=> Execution Context 
    1. Global Execution Context: {}
    2. Functional Execution Context: ()
    3. Eval Execution Context <!-- for Mongooes --> (this is a property of global object)

Q4.What is Call stack in JS?
=> Call Stack means you have a memory, now how will you exexute that memory's functions, and how you will run it. 



**Async Javascript fundamentals**
----------------------------------

-> This-variable mainly refers window object.
-> Execution Context --- execute one line of code at a time.

Example:                 **Each opartion wait for the last one to complete before executing**
        |               --------------------------------------------------------------------
        |               
        |  console.log(1); (1st line will execute)
        |  console.log(2); (then the 2nd line will execute)
       \ /
    Execution Context
    
    CALL STACK(lifo)               MEMORY HEEP (the storing procces)



Blocking Code                        vs                 Non Blocking Code 
    1.Block the flow of program                           1.Don't block the exection
    2.Read the file as Sync                               2.Read the file as Async
